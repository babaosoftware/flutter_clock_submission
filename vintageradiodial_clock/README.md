# Vintage Radio Dial Digital Clock

This is an application that creates a clock face that resembles a vintage radio dial.
There are three scales, the upper one for hours, the middle for current temperature and weather condition, and the lower for minutes.
The upper dial marker's position is relative to the current minute.
The lower dial marker's position is relative to the current second.
The middle scale shows a gradient of the current temperature range, with the current temperature relatively positioned inside. There's also an icon the corresponds to the current weather condition.
